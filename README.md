# The Rules
The CAPTCHA is a digital Simon Says game that becomes infuriatingly harder with each turn.

1. There are 7 to 9 turns in total:
    - 45% chance of 7 turns (easy ~1-3 minutes)
    - 45% chance of 8 turns (hard ~5-10 minutes)
    - 10% chance of 9 turns (very hard ~10+ minutes)
    
2. The player must click the correct buttons shown by the CAPTCHA to complete each turn. There is a 3 second time limit between each player click to prevent cheating.

3. The game introduces tricks as the rounds progress to increase or decrease difficulty:
    - In round 3 the background starts flashing random colors to confuse the player which take full effect in round 6.
    - In round 4 the platform starts spinning.
    - In round 5 the board starts rotating the opposite direction after each player click.
    - In round 6 the game turns black & white.
    - In round 7 the platform starts bouncing off the edges of the CAPTCHA container.
    - Spinning and the speed at which pieces are played by the computer increase each round.
    - The platform spins increasingly faster with each user click, which resets at the beginning of a turn.
    - The platform spins a lot faster with each click when you first launch the game, but the spinning slows down
    and becomes more fair after 4 failed attempts.
