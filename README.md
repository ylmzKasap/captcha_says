# The Rules
The CAPTCHA is a digital Simon Says game that becomes infuriatingly harder with each turn.

1. There are 7 to 9 turns in total:
    - 50% chance of 7 turns (easy)
    - 40% chance of 8 turns (hard)
    - 10% chance of 9 turns (very hard)
    
2. The player must click the correct buttons shown by the CAPTCHA to complete each turn. There is a 3 second time limit between each player click to prevent cheating.

3. The game introduces tricks as the rounds progress to increase difficulty:
  - In round 3 the background starts flashing random colors to confuse the player which take full effect in round 6.
  - In round 4 the platform starts spinning.
  - In round 7 the platform starts bouncing off the edges of the CAPTCHA container.
  - Spinning and the speed at which pieces are played by the computer increase each round.
